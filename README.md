 The Employee Management System (EMS) is a user-friendly platform with two parts:    1. **Admin Panel:** Manage employees by adding, updating, or deleting records, viewing attendance, and handling leave requests.   2. **Employee Login:** Employees can mark attendance, apply for leave, check leave status, and log out securely.
